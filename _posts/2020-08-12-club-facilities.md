I am pleased to say that we can start to open up some facilities at the club! 


Now that the government has allowed gyms to open, we can open up the club for land training, however there are certain procedures which need to be followed. Due to the size of our club and the social distancing rules we will only be allowed to have five people training in the club at any one time. To try and control this we are asking people to complete the clubs google document attached to this email. This will then allow people to book a slot. It is important that this is followed to ensure we do not exceed the number of people in the club and for tract and trace purposes so it can be seen who was training etc. Obviously if you or anyone in your household is showing any covid symptoms then please do not attend.  

 
There will be a one-way system in the club house and we ask that members enter through the back door and exit through the front shutter door. There are also several hand sanitizers in the club along with a blue roll. Please sanitize your hands when entering and exiting the club and make sure any used blue roll is placed in the bin provided. All club equipment is to be sterilized when used, and please be mindful that anything you touch will need to be cleaned. This includes when the trailers are moved in and out of the club. Please also keep all the doors in the club open while you train for ventilation.  

 
We are aware everyone is keen to get on the water and therefore the committee have agreed that the coastal single can be used. However, if you wish to use the coastal single it will need to be booked through the google document in the same way training needs to be booked. The single can only go afloat if someone is in the club and they will be required to take a VHF radio with them, the members which are remaining in the club will also have the radio on so there is a means of contact. However, obviously in the case of an emergency the coastguard can be contacted on channel 16 and the Harbour Master on channel 14. The club's rib can go afloat as a coaching launch, as only the driver is able to be in the rib and therefore this cannot be used as a rescue boat as this would require more people on board which is not allowed. If you require someone to take the rib as a coaching launch please arrange this prior to your outing with a coach. 


I know everyone is keen to get back and some of the rules might not be ideal for everyone but if they are not adhered to then the club will be closed again. Please remember that no fine boats can currently go on the water and that only the coastal single is allowed at the moment when booked. The guidelines are constantly changing and as a committee we are doing our best to hold meeting to discuss how the guideline can be implemented in our club in the safest and most fair way. News on the clubs next steps will be issued shortly which we hope to be able to include the use of more boats being available.  


Thank you for all your patient, and as always if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.  


Thanks
