Hello Everyone  

Its been a while since the last club update, if you don't wish to continue to receive these updates then please let me know.  

Sunday Morning sessions are still on going and is open to all members. Any new members wishing to start rowing are encouraged to come along to these sessions to get out in a boat. Tea and coffee are available after the outing and the last Sunday of every month there are bacon sandwiches available for a small donation of £2. Hopefully as the weather improves and the lighter evening come there will be more chance to get on the water.   

The co-op fund is still ongoing and has currently raised £162 for the club. If you have not got your co-op membership card yet or selected Torquay rowing club as your charity then please do, as the more people that do this the more money the club will raise. Any questions regarding this, just let me know.  

The clubs AGM is to be held at the RTYC in the Billiard Room on Friday 27th March at 8PM. Further details regarding this will be sent to members tomorrow. Therefore if you do not receive anything by the end of next week please let me know so i can ensure we hold the correct address for you. I would also like to remind members that membership is now over due and would ask if you have not already paid to do so as soon as possible.  

Organisation of the clubs events for the year are already underway and hope that members will support or help out where possible at these events. A calendar of all the WEARA and coastal regattas is available from the WEARA website.    

Finally, I know its all we seem to be hearing about in the news but thought it would be worth mentioning, that in light of the recent coronavirus cases, please could all members wipe down the ergos/mats/equipment used with the antibacterial wipes which are in the club house.   

If you have any questions or suggestions you would like to put forward to the committee then please do not hesitate to contact me.   

Kind Regards  
Charlotte Hunt  
Torquay Rowing Club Secretary.
