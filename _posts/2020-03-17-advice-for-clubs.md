## Advice for Clubs

There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to our Affiliated Clubs as the activities and facilities in each one differ.  We recommend that each club reviews their various activities and the associated risk in line with the Government advice. Clubs may wish to consider:

* reducing the risk profile – for example:
  * enhancing cleaning measures
  * limiting or stopping indoor activities
  * considering how many people are required on site to safely deliver any activity
  * not allowing any visitors
* considering which of your member may be at higher risk
  * reducing the group size – for example:
  * staggering training times
  * moving ergos outdoors
  * utilising more cross training at or away from the club

## Message from the Club  

We are only a small club so I would say if you are training this should be limited at the moment to a max of 10 people in the boathouse and consider moving the ergos outside for training.  

There is some anti bacterial spray as that is all we have to spray handles and seats of ergos and the training mats if used.  

If anyone could purchase some more this would be appreciated but don’t all buy it as it only requires one person to purchase it.  

The card hanging up on the notice board can be used to enter the toilet block to wash your hands after training.  

Those aged 0-69 if you are unwell then please do not come down the club and isolate yourself for 7 days and you are advised against Social mixing.  

Those aged 70+ or have an underlying health condition if you are unwell then please do not come down the club, isolate yourself for 7 days and you are strongly advised against Social mixing.
