Please use the following link to book sessions in the club and on the water, take note of a previous message from Charlotte below. [Google Drive Booking Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bsuoXKy5FEBWP4_44f5c927fvX5bYmGq?usp=sharing_eip&ts=5f207cc5)  

"Due to the size of our club and the social distancing rules we will only be allowed to have five people training in the club at any one time. To try and control this we are asking people to complete the clubs google document attached to this email. This will then allow people to book a slot. It is important that this is followed to ensure we do not exceed the number of people in the club and for tract and trace purposes so it can be seen who was training etc." - 29/07/2020
