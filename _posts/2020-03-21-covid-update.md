Following on from British Rowing's latest guidelines, I am sorry to say that until further notice all the clubs training sessions have been cancelled. Therefore there will be no training in the evenings or any Sunday sessions.

The clubs AGM has also been postponed and a new date for this is still to be decided.   

Currently Exmouth and Plymouth have cancelled up and coming coastal races and we are monitoring the situation with regards our thatcher Rock race due to be on the 16th of May.   

The RTYC bar and restaurant is also closed, however within the next couple of days the chef John will be launching a home delivery service providing competitively priced, quality, home-cooked meals from the Club kitchen. He is experiencing no food supply issues with wholesalers. So if you would like to support John and take him up on this offer please contact him.   

The committee will be closely monitoring the situation, and as soon as we can get the doors open and back on the water we will be!!   

During these uncertain times, on behalf of the committee I would like to send well wishes to all our members and family and hope to see you all soon!   

Stay safe!
