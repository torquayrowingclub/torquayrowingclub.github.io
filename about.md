Torquay Rowing Club is the oldest sporting club in Torbay, founded in 1869.

Although boats and equipment have changed dramatically during its long history, the aims of the club remain the same: To foster the sport of amateur rowing and to provide amenities for it's members.

The club has been affiliated to the Royal Torbay Yacht Club since the early 1980s. As a result, all Torquay Rowing Club members are also members of the yacht club and enjoy full use of the facilities it provides.

The club isn't all rowing. Many formal and informal Social events are organised throughout the year from barbecues, rounders and bowling nights to the Crab Supper, Club Supper and the finest Christmas event in Torbay, the Holly Ball.
